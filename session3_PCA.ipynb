We sometimes have machine learning problems in which input features have very high dimensions, which complicates machine learning, increasing processing and reducing accuracy. \nSo, our first task is to reduce high dimensional input feature space, to a lower dimensional space which is more effective in machine learning task. \nSo PCA has several benefits including data compression, improved visualization, increasing performance, simplifying machine learning models etc.\n\nIt is important to note that it is not only possible to reduce dimensionality of input feature space using PCA while retaining most of the variability of the data, but it is also possible to reconstruct the the original data through back projection techniques. \n","metadata":{"_uuid":"7c032d2aaf45d303dc04a0c25d49ca6873f4e2a0"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Importance of Feature Scaling**\n\nFeature scaling through standardization (or Z-score normalization) can be an important preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms. Standardization involves rescaling the features such that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n\nWhile many algorithms (such as SVM, K-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression) require features to be normalized, intuitively we can think of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) as being a prime example of when normalization is important. In PCA we are interested in the components that maximize the variance. If one component (e.g. human height) varies less than another (e.g. weight) because of their respective scales (meters vs. kilos), PCA might determine that the direction of maximal variance more closely corresponds with the ‘weight’ axis, if those features are not scaled. As a change in height of one meter can be considered much more important than the change in weight of one kilogram, this is clearly incorrect.\nReference : [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_scaling_importance.html]\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"b1e7bea4eadd889f726cb17d500d3376634338c9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from __future__ import print_function\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_wine\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nprint(__doc__)\n\n# Code source: Tyler Lanigan <tylerlanigan@gmail.com>\n#              Sebastian Raschka <mail@sebastianraschka.com>\n\n# License: BSD 3 clause\n\nRANDOM_STATE = 42\nFIG_SIZE = (10, 7)\n\n\nfeatures, target = load_wine(return_X_y=True)\n\n# Make a train/test split using 30% test size\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target,\n                                                    test_size=0.30,\n                                                    random_state=RANDOM_STATE)\n\n# Fit to data and predict using pipelined GNB and PCA.\nunscaled_clf = make_pipeline(PCA(n_components=2), GaussianNB())\nunscaled_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\npred_test = unscaled_clf.predict(X_test)\n\n# Fit to data and predict using pipelined scaling, GNB and PCA.\nstd_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), PCA(n_components=2), GaussianNB())\nstd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\npred_test_std = std_clf.predict(X_test)\n\n# Show prediction accuracies in scaled and unscaled data.\nprint('\\nPrediction accuracy for the normal test dataset with PCA')\nprint('{:.2%}\\n'.format(metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, pred_test)))\n\nprint('\\nPrediction accuracy for the standardized test dataset with PCA')\nprint('{:.2%}\\n'.format(metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, pred_test_std)))\n\n# Extract PCA from pipeline\npca = unscaled_clf.named_steps['pca']\npca_std = std_clf.named_steps['pca']\n\n# Show first principal components\nprint('\\nPC 1 without scaling:\\n', pca.components_[0])\nprint('\\nPC 1 with scaling:\\n', pca_std.components_[0])\n\n# Scale and use PCA on X_train data for visualization.\nscaler = std_clf.named_steps['standardscaler']\nX_train_std = pca_std.transform(scaler.transform(X_train))\n\n# visualize standardized vs. untouched dataset with PCA performed\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=FIG_SIZE)\n\n\nfor l, c, m in zip(range(0, 3), ('blue', 'red', 'green'), ('^', 's', 'o')):\n    ax1.scatter(X_train[y_train == l, 0], X_train[y_train == l, 1],\n                color=c,\n                label='class %s' % l,\n                alpha=0.5,\n                marker=m\n                )\n\nfor l, c, m in zip(range(0, 3), ('blue', 'red', 'green'), ('^', 's', 'o')):\n    ax2.scatter(X_train_std[y_train == l, 0], X_train_std[y_train == l, 1],\n                color=c,\n                label='class %s' % l,\n                alpha=0.5,\n                marker=m\n                )\n\nax1.set_title('Training dataset after PCA')\nax2.set_title('Standardized training dataset after PCA')\n\nfor ax in (ax1, ax2):\n    ax.set_xlabel('1st principal component')\n    ax.set_ylabel('2nd principal component')\n    ax.legend(loc='upper right')\n    ax.grid()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Correlated Data in Nature**\n\nYou are given an array grains giving the width and length of samples of grain.

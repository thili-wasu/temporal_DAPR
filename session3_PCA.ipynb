        "Principal component analysis(PCA) is considered as one of the most popular technique for linearly independent feature extractiond and dimensionality reduction. We sometimes have machine learning problems in which input features have very high dimensions, which complicates machine learning, increasing processing and reducing accuracy.\n",
        "So, our first task is to reduce high dimensional input feature space, to a lower dimensional space which is more effective in machine learning task.\n",
        "So PCA has several benefits including data compression, improved visualization, increasing performance, simplifying machine learning models etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that it is not only possible to reduce dimensionality of input feature space using PCA while retaining most of the variability of the data, but it is also possible to reconstruct the the original data through back projection techniques.\n"

        "\n",
        "Feature scaling through standardization (or Z-score normalization) can be an important preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms. Standardization involves rescaling the features such that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n",
        "\n",
        "While many algorithms (such as SVM, K-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression) require features to be normalized, intuitively we can think of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) as being a prime example of when normalization is important. In PCA we are interested in the components that maximize the variance. If one component (e.g. human height) varies less than another (e.g. weight) because of their respective scales (meters vs. kilos), PCA might determine that the direction of maximal variance more closely corresponds with the ‘weight’ axis, if those features are not scaled. As a change in height of one meter can be considered much more important than the change in weight of one kilogram, this is clearly incorrect.\n",

While PCA does improve performance in many cases, but it is no silver bullet as pointed out by Andrew Ng, \"Don't assume you need to do PCA. Try your full machine learning algorithm without PCA first. Then use PCA if you find that you need it.\"\n",
